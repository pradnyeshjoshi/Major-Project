The lights, the outdoor seating arrangement are all just perfect. The place is very spacious and being situated in the middle of a garden, it provides a very unique experience. Though I was here with a friend, I still had an amazing time. We opted to sit in one of those personal carriages. We reached quite early for dinner, at around 7, but within an hour and a half, the place was packed and buzzing with people. I do not particularly remember our orders, but the food was good and served in decent portions. The service could have been slightly better, in my opinion. But overall, a very good experience!","reviewTime":"2015-09-23 16:04:26","reviewTimeFriendly":"2 days ago","timestamp":1443004466,"ratingColor":"5BA829","user_id":"31497209","foodie_level":"Big Foodie","foodie_color":"ffae4f","thumb":"https:\/\/b.zmtcdn.com\/data\/user_profile_pictures\/91c\/a892afa196f5cc4260a89d82ef8b391c_200_thumb.jpg"}},{"review":{"id":"25009113","userName":"Ambika Mathur","rating":5,"rating_5":4.5,"reviewText":"There is absolutely nothing to dislike at lodi.\nThe ambience is warm and its the perfect place to have dinner (preferably on a cosy winter evening)\nThe lights add a certain warmth to the place and the decor is such that you feel like never leaving the place.\nSince we were quite a large contingent, we eneded up ordering the cheese platter which was exquisite, the kabab platter and the vegetarian mezze platter. We ordered a no. Of pastas and the most delicious jumbo prawns one can find in delhi.\nThe service was prompt and the food divine. This is most definitely the place for a romantic evening although an outing with friends here would be fun too.\nOh and a Big shoutout to the music they play!
